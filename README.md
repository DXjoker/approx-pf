Approximate linear solution of power flow equations in power distribution networks

This repository contains the GNU Octave and MatPower source code used in the paper

S. Bolognani and S. Zampieri, "On the existence and linear approximation of the power flow solution in power distribution networks", submitted to IEEE Transactions on Power Systems, 2014.

- paper.m generates the data and the plots that have been used in the paper.
- scenarios.m generates extra data and extra plots for a number of practical scenarios.
- techreport.pdf discussion of the data and plots generated by scenarios.m

Simulations are based on a modified version of the IEEE 123 test feeder, which is available as a MatPower case file in the MatPower directory.

- The original IEEE 123 test feeder is available at http://ewh.ieee.org/soc/pes/dsacom/testfeeders/index.html
